C Projects created for the Linux OS.<br></br>
Project 1 uses TCP communication to allow a client program to request a file stored on a server computer.  The client program takes the requested file entered by the user and adds an HTTP header.  It then uses an HTTP GET request in order to obtain the proper file from the server.  That file is then able to be accessed by the client once it is successfully received.<br></br>
Project 2 uses UDP communication to form a ring of connections between clients requesting access to a private bulletin board file.  The server processes their requests, orders them based on the time they connected, forwards their IP addresses and port numbers to individual clients' neighbors and steps out of the ring.  A "token" is passed around the ring to allow updates to the bulletin board only when it is the correct client's time to access it.  Multithreading allows the token to be passed around indefinitely for clients to read from the bulletin board but never allows access to write until they are supposed to.  When a client in the ring leaves or a new client requests access to the file, a connected client is picked as a psuedo-server and reevalutes the ring.
